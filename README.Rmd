Open an R session and run the following commands to install required packages:

```{R eval = FALSE}
install.packages(c("devtools", "magrittr"))

devtools::install_github("hadley/dplyr", "hadley/ggplot2", "hadley/plyr", "hadley/tidyr", "hadley/readr" ,"hadley/readxl")
```

Make sure you create a directory with subdirectories named "R", "data" and "plots". Put the R scripts in the subdirectory "R" and the input data in the "data" subdirectory.

Execute the scripts from subdirectory "R".

```{r echo = FALSE}
system("tree /Users/vitoraguiar/aschaueriana2", intern = TRUE)
```
